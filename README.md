##  Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and addressing gender-related inequalities within Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company operating across three regions. The primary goal is to uncover disparities in gender distribution, performance evaluation, and salary structure using HR data analysis.
By examining employee data through Power BI, the project aims to: Provide the management with evidence-based insights on gender representation, highlight areas with potential gender pay gaps, assess compliance with new wage regulations, and support strategic decision-making around HR policy reform, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and compensation fairness.
Ultimately, the analysis supports Palmoriaâ€™s broader goal of transforming into a more equitable and globally competitive organization, ready for regional and international expansion.

##  Overall Conclusion
- The HR data analysis conducted for Palmoria Group revealed critical gender-based disparities within the organization that require immediate strategic attention. Through in-depth exploration using Power BI, it became evident that gender imbalance, pay inequality, and inconsistent performance recognition exist across several departments and regions.

- Firstly, the analysis showed a significant skew in gender distribution, with male employees dominating several core departments, particularly in technical and leadership roles. Some departments even recorded zero female representation, which raises concerns about the companyâ€™s recruitment, promotion, and retention practices.

- Secondly, there were clear indicators of a gender pay gap, particularly in regions like the South and departments such as Engineering, where male employees consistently earned more than their female counterparts for similar roles. This violates the principle of equal pay for equal work and could expose the company to reputational and legal risks.

- Moreover, performance rating analysis indicated a trend where male employees were more frequently awarded higher ratings. Since these ratings influence both bonus allocation and career progression, the implications are substantialâ€”female employees are not just underpaid but also undervalued in terms of recognition and reward.

- In terms of regulatory compliance, the company is not fully aligned with the newly adopted $90,000 minimum wage requirement. A considerable number of employees, especially in the South region, fall below this threshold, signaling an urgent need for salary adjustments.

- The bonus distribution analysis helped calculate fair, performance-based compensation and revealed which regions and departments require more budget attention. It also supported creating a more transparent and structured bonus framework.

- Final Summary

Overall, the findings underscore the need for Palmoria Group to restructure its HR strategy, with a focus on gender equity, fair pay practices, and inclusive performance management. By implementing the recommendations derived from this analysisâ€”such as targeted hiring, equitable salary reviews, and unbiased performance evaluationsâ€”the company can begin to rebuild trust, foster a more inclusive culture, and position itself for sustainable growth both locally and globally.
