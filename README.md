##  Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and addressing gender-related inequalities within Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company operating across three regions. The primary goal is to uncover disparities in gender distribution, performance evaluation, and salary structure using HR data analysis.
By examining employee data through Power BI, the project aims to: Provide the management with evidence-based insights on gender representation, highlight areas with potential gender pay gaps, assess compliance with new wage regulations, and support strategic decision-making around HR policy reform, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and compensation fairness.
Ultimately, the analysis supports Palmoria‚Äôs broader goal of transforming into a more equitable and globally competitive organization, ready for regional and international expansion.

## Objectives
- Understand gender distribution across departments and regions
- Analyze performance ratings by gender
- Identify if a gender pay gap exists and locate where it's most critical
- Evaluate compliance with the newly introduced $90,000 minimum wage law
- Allocate bonus payments based on employee performance ratings

---

##  Tools Used
- **Power BI** (for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis) 
- **DAX** and **Power Query** (for calculated fields and logic)
- **Excel** (preprocessing and supporting bonus rule data)

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned null departments and inactive employees
- Assigned "Undisclosed" to missing gender entries
- Created salary bands in intervals of $10,000
- Merged datasets for bonus allocation based on performance

##  Key Analysis & Insights:
   Data Visualization:
 - The analysis results were visualized using PowerBI.
 - Slicers were implemented to provide interactivity and enhance the dashboard's usability. Overall, the analysis and visualization process facilitated a thorough examination of the data, enabling the extraction of      valuable insights and presenting them in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

  These are as a result of our analysis:
  
### 1. Gender Distribution
- Males dominate the workforce across all three regions.
- Some departments had no female representation, indicating bias in hiring or retention.

### 2. Ratings vs Gender
- Males received slightly higher average ratings.
- Fewer women were found in the top performance category, which affects bonuses and promotions.

### 3. Gender Pay Gap
- Significant pay gaps found in departments like Engineering and Sales.
- South and West regions showed more disparity than the North.

### 4. Minimum Wage Compliance
- Not all employees earned the required minimum of $90,000.
- Most below-compliance salaries were in the South region.
- Created a salary band chart showing how many employees fall within each $10,000 range.

### 5. Bonus Allocation
- Bonuses were calculated based on a secondary dataset with rating-to-bonus rules.
- Total salary (base + bonus) was computed for each employee.
- Regional bonus payout summary was generated for budgeting.

---

##  Recommendations
- **Diversity hiring drive** for underrepresented departments and regions
- **Internal review of performance appraisal processes** to ensure fairness
- **Immediate salary adjustment** for employees earning below the legal minimum
- **Close monitoring of pay structure** to ensure equal pay for equal roles
- **Mentorship and promotion pathways** for high-performing female staff

##  Conclusion
This analysis helps Palmoria Group take proactive steps to improve workplace equality, restore its public image, and meet regulatory requirements. With proper implementation of the recommendations, the company can build a more inclusive and equitable workplace.
