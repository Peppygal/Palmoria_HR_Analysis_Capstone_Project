##  Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and addressing gender-related inequalities within Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company operating across three regions. The primary goal is to uncover disparities in gender distribution, performance evaluation, and salary structure using HR data analysis.
By examining employee data through Power BI, the project aims to: Provide the management with evidence-based insights on gender representation, highlight areas with potential gender pay gaps, assess compliance with new wage regulations, and support strategic decision-making around HR policy reform, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and compensation fairness.
Ultimately, the analysis supports Palmoriaâ€™s broader goal of transforming into a more equitable and globally competitive organization, ready for regional and international expansion.

## Analysis And Insights:
   Data Visualization:
 - The analysis results were visualized using PowerBI.
 - Slicers were implemented to provide interactivity and enhance the dashboard's usability. Overall, the analysis and visualization process facilitated a thorough examination of the data, enabling the extraction of valuable insights and presenting them in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

  These are as a result of our analysis:

### Gender Distribution by Department

Result:

Male: 49.15%

Female: 46.62%

Undisclosed: 4.23%

Insight: The gender distribution across departments is relatively balanced, with males holding a slight majority. Female representation is strong, but still trails slightly behind. The 4.23% of employees who did not disclose their gender should be considered in future HR planning to improve transparency and engagement.

### Department Distribution by Region

Result:

Kaduna: 38.16%

Lagos: 26.43%

Abuja: 35.41%

Insight: Kaduna has the largest concentration of employees across departments, suggesting it may be the companyâ€™s operational hub. Abuja follows closely, while Lagos has the smallest departmental spread. This indicates that HR interventions, hiring, and gender policies may need to be region-specific, especially in Cardona where most of the workforce is concentrated.

### Rating Distribution by Gender

Result:

Male: 465 ratings

Female: 441 ratings

Undisclosed: 40 ratings

Insight: Males slightly outnumber females in total performance ratings, which reflects the gender ratio of the workforce. However, the gap is not extreme, which is a good sign of balanced appraisal activity. The lower count for undisclosed gender may suggest a lack of visibility or exclusion in formal evaluations. This should be addressed to ensure inclusivity in performance management.

### Average Salary by Gender

Male: $74,790

Female: $72,136

Undisclosed: $78,368

Insight: Average salary data shows that male employees earn slightly more than female and undisclosed employees. While the gap is smaller than what is typically seen in many organizations, it still reflects a potential gender pay imbalance. A detailed salary audit is recommended to ensure fair compensation based on role and performance, not gender.

### Salary Distribution by Gender

Male: $34,777

Female: $31,811

Undisclosed: $3,134

Insight: This visual highlights how salaries are distributed across male, female, and undisclosed employees. If males are more concentrated in higher salary bands, it supports the observed pay gap and may be influenced by role assignment, seniority, or performance outcomes. If the salary bands are balanced, it shows positive progress toward equitable pay.

### Annual Bonus Distribution by Location

Kaduna: $825,911
Abuja: $801,144
Lagos: $572,223

Insight: Kaduna received the highest total bonus payout ($825,911), followed by Abuja ($801,144), and Lagos with the lowest ($572,223). This suggests that Kaduna likely has the largest workforce or more high-performing employees, while Lagos may have fewer staff or lower average ratings. The distribution highlights performance and workforce size differences across regions and can help guide future HR and compensation decisions.

##  Key Strategies and Recommendations:

1. Promote Gender Balance Across Departments

Strategy: Launch targeted recruitment campaigns aimed at increasing female representation, especially in male-dominated departments like Engineering, Sales, and Manufacturing, this helps Balance teams promote innovation, collaboration, and reduce reputational risks tied to gender bias.

2. Conduct Regular Pay Equity Audits

Strategy: Implement quarterly or biannual reviews of employee salaries by gender, department, and region.

Reason: To monitor and correct any pay gaps and ensure equal pay for equal roles and experience levels.

3. Ensure Compliance with Minimum Wage Policy

Strategy: Immediately adjust salaries for employees earning below the $90,000 threshold to align with legal standards.

Reason: Avoid penalties, legal challenges, and foster fairness and employee trust.

4. Redesign Performance Evaluation Process

Strategy: Standardize and anonymize parts of the performance appraisal system to remove unconscious bias. Include diverse panels for performance reviews.

Reason: Fairer evaluations will improve morale, trust, and align rewards more closely with actual contributions.

5. Build a Transparent Bonus Framework

Strategy: Publish clear bonus rules based on performance ratings and ensure that all employees understand the criteria.

Reason: Transparency drives accountability and ensures perceived fairness in reward systems.

6. Invest in Female Talent Development

Strategy: Create mentorship programs, leadership training, and career advancement paths specifically for high-potential female employees.

Reason: To strengthen the pipeline of female leaders and close representation gaps at management levels.

7. Implement a Region-Specific HR Action Plan

Strategy: Customize HR initiatives based on regional insights (e.g., South region salary adjustments, West region gender diversity improvements).

Reason: A one-size-fits-all approach may not address the specific challenges found in each region.

8. Track and Report Diversity KPIs

Strategy: Integrate gender diversity metrics into the companyâ€™s HR dashboards and management reports.

Reason: Helps leadership stay accountable and track progress toward equity goals over time.

- These recommendations are designed to help Palmoria Group:

- Improve internal equity

- Comply with labor regulations

- Foster a more inclusive workplace culture

- And ultimately position itself as a modern, ethical, and competitive employer.

##  Overall Conclusion

The HR data analysis conducted for Palmoria Group revealed key structural and equity-related insights that are critical to the companyâ€™s growth, compliance, and organizational culture. The gender distribution across the company is relatively balanced, with males representing 49.15%, females 46.62%, and 4.23% of employees choosing not to disclose their gender. However, certain departments and regions still show signs of gender clustering, where either males or females dominate specific roles, particularly in technical and leadership areas.

Performance rating distribution shows that male and female employees are nearly evenly rated, though slight disparities still exist that could influence bonus eligibility and career progression. The average salary analysis revealed that males generally earn more than their female counterparts, pointing to a potential gender pay gap that needs to be addressed through transparent compensation reviews.

Regionally, Cardona hosts the highest number of employees and also received the largest share of total bonus payouts, followed by Abuja and Lagos. This trend suggests that workforce size and performance may be concentrated in specific regions, but it also raises questions about equitable distribution of rewards and opportunities across all locations.

Additionally, the rating and salary data indicate that some employees are still earning below the minimum wage threshold, particularly in regions like the South (if applicable to your earlier analysis), which may affect regulatory compliance and employee morale if not corrected.

In summary, the analysis has provided valuable insights into workforce composition, compensation structure, and regional dynamics within Palmoria Group. Addressing these findings through targeted HR strategies, including fair pay audits, performance review reforms, and diversity-focused initiatives, will help the company build a more inclusive, compliant, and performance-driven workplace as it prepares for further expansion. 

By implementing the recommendations derived from this analysisâ€”such as targeted hiring, equitable salary reviews, and unbiased performance evaluationsâ€”the company can begin to rebuild trust, foster a more inclusive culture, and position itself for sustainable growth both locally and globally.
